# A DBT(DATA-BUILD-TOOL) Project

In this project I explored DBT in other to understand the nitty gritty and features of dbt. I setup my cloud data platform - snowflake, installed dbt using pip, performed basic transformation in the staging database and modelled a few tables in the warehouse.




## Tools
* snowflake
* DBT 
* SQL



## setup snowflake environment
1. created roles, databases, schemas, datawarehouse and granted necessary permissions. The query used can be found in full_script.sql

2. ingested data into the raw database
the data ingested was hardcoded. the query used can be found in full_script.sql

3. installed dbt
* created a folder for the project

* created a virtual environment for my dbt project
```bash
python -m venv dbt-env
```     

activated the environment        
dbt-env/scripts/activate       
N.B: If you install dbt in a virtual environment, you need to reactivate that same virtual environment each time you create a shell window or session  

pip install dbt-snowflake
I used the snowflake adapter because I am working with snowflake database

4. Initialized dbt project
created a new folder

initialized dbt project in new folder
dbt init [foldername]

configured profile for dbt project by inputting details that were prompted
* dev credentials were used as default configuration
* prod credentials were configured later in the profile.yml file 

5. Build project
created two folders, one for staging (staging) and the other for warehouse and reporting (mart)
created folders for the different schemas in the staging folder
in each schema folder I declared sources in yaml files(src_fandango.yml & src_avengers.yml) for the schemas
configured materialization and schema for staging, warehouse and reporting in dbt_project.yml file
created a custom schema by using the macro "generate_schema_name"
created staging models by referencing sources: 
performed basic transformations such as creating id columns, changing data types, harmonizing the name of columns, splitting columns e.t.c
created warehouse and reporting models by referencing staging models
editted database configuration in source files in other to deploy models in development environment to production environment
deployed project to production environment by running dbt run --target prod
created singular test and added it to test file
created generic test to test for unique id columns and empty name columns by adding it to schema.yml file 
created custom test to check if values in year columns are valid by creating a macro and adding it to the schema.yml file 
generated documentation for project

 



deactivate to deactivate virtual environment
dbt --version  check for version of dbt
dbt debug to validate connection
dbt clean clears out target file
dbt run -s <name of models> to run specific models
dbt run -s +<name of model> to run a model and all its dependencies
dbt docs generate to generate documentation
dbt dbt serve to visulize the documentation in the website
dbt build to deploy the project sequentially
